# M5---Forecasting-Uncertainty
To estimate the uncertainty distribution of unit sales of various products sold by Walmart in the USA as precisely as possible. This specific competition is the first of its kind, opening up new directions for both academic research and how uncertainty could be assessed and used in organizations. The goal of the competition is to help companies achieve accurate predictions, estimate the levels of uncertainty, avoiding costly mistakes, and apply best forecasting practices. In this competition, you will use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the world's largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days and to make uncertainty estimates for these forecasts. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details.
